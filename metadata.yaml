description: Jason dinAlt is a professional gambler who uses his somewhat erratic
  psionic abilities to tip the odds in his favor. He is challenged by a man named
  Kerk Pyrrus to turn a large amount of money into an immense sum by gambling at a
  government-run casino. He succeeds and survives the planetary government's desperate
  efforts to steal back the money. He then decides to accompany Kerk to his home,
  despite being warned that it is the deadliest world ever colonized by humans.
